# NowlanLab_PerthesPlot
## Usage
This Perthes Plot Generator is built using Shiny in R to generate bar chart and pie charts for segmentation data quantification. <br />
Link to the generator: https://carolwu.shinyapps.io/PlotWebPage/ <br />
1. Compile segementation statistic from 3D Slicer in example dataset format: <br />
   a. see patient1.csv for all segments  <br />
   b. see patient1_malperfused.csv for malperfused area  <br />
2. Upload these two csv files to the Perthes Plot Generator webpage and enter patient id for the plot title (example: "Patient 15A")  <br />
3. Plots are automatically generated in tabpanels <br />
## Notes
1. Without user input the Perthes Plot Generator will use the example datasets to generate plots.  <br />
2. There is a radio button for pie chart of hip volumes to choose which side the pie chart of the perthes side should be on (left/right).<br />
3. The difference between relative sizes of the femoral head on both side is not shown in the interactive plot generated by plotly, but there is a static pie chart below the interactive one showing the size difference based on the total volume of each side. <br />
4. There is a checkbox for displaying legend for the pie chart of malperfused area. <br />
5. If the text in the pie chart of malperfused area is cutoff, use the slider to adjust rotation angle for the pie chart. <br />
